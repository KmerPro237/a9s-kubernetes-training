  "description": "ConfigMaps and Secrets are utilities provided by Kubernetes to fascilitate the development of cloud-native - or 12 factor [1] compliant - applications. In particular, ConfigMaps relate to chapter 3 *Config* of the 12 factor manifest. This best practice suggests to store application configuration outside the application, e.g. by using environment variables [2]. This allows a strict separation of functionality and configuration which increases the portability of applications. An application can thus be operated from the same code base among different environments such as staging & production or the application could even be deployed *per customer* still using a single source code version.",
